## Creating alerts
To create an alert, use the "Create Alert" button in the Discord server. You can leave fields blank to not use it for matches. i.e. if you want to match *all* X42 buses, don't fill in the time or direction.

## Deleting alerts
Simply use the /delete_alert command with the alert ID. You can find the alert ID by listing your alerts with the button in the Discord server.

## Delivery methods
Notifications can be delivered via a channel in the Discord server, or via DMs. If you want to use DMs make sure to enable DMs from server members in the server settings.
